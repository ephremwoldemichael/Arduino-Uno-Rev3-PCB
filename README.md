# Arduino Uno Rev3 – Schematic & PCB Design (Altium)

This project is a full **Arduino Uno Rev3** hardware redesign created in **Altium Designer**.
It includes both the **schematic** and a complete **PCB layout**, following the original Arduino Uno architecture.

##  Main Components

* ATmega328P microcontroller
* ATmega16U2 (USB-to-serial)
* Voltage regulators (5V & 3.3V)
* Power jack & USB Type-B
* Crystal oscillators
* Digital & analog I/O headers
* Reset circuitry


## 🎯 What This Project Demonstrates

* Schematic design in Altium
* PCB routing, grounding, and power distribution
* Microcontroller hardware design
* Component placement based on real Arduino Uno standards


## How to Use

1. Open the project in **Altium Designer**.
2. View the schematic and PCB Layout files.
3. Generate Gerbers if you want to manufacture the board.
